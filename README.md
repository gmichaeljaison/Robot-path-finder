# Robot-path-finder
Genetic Algorithm based path finder with static and dynamic obstalces

Project built on 2011 as part of the Soft Computing course in PSG College of Technology.

  As part of the project, I implemented an IEEE paper "Genetic Algorithm Based Path Planning and Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance of Mobile Robots" by Woong-Gie Han, Seung-Min Baek and Tae-Yong Kuc.
  
### Abstract:
  A simple path planning scheme for navigation of mobile robots while avoiding obstacles. In generating the goal directed dynamic path, the path panning scheme uses a genetic search algorithm whose coding technique speeds up the execution of genetic search for fast path generation. The fitness value of the generated paths is evaluated in terms of the safety from the obstructing dynamic objects and the distance to the goal position by the genetic algorithm. The execution time of genetic search is further accelerated by projecting the two dimensional data to one dimensional ones to reduce the size of search space
